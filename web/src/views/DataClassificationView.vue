        <p>Choose a data classification that best fits the files in your drive. If some files are more sensitive than others, choose the more restrictive classification. Consult the <a href="https://research-hub.auckland.ac.nz/article/research-data-classification" class="btn-link" target="_blank">Research data classification standard</a> for further guidance.</p>
